▶️ Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project | AtliQ Hardware

Excited to share my latest Power BI bootcamp project, where I built an end-to-end Business Insights 360 dashboard for AtliQ Hardware  - analyzing financial, sales, marketing, and supply chain data to uncover actionable insights and support strategic decision-making.

🎯 Project Objective
 Design an intuitive, stakeholder-friendly Power BI dashboard to improve data accessibility, enable faster decisions, and drive sustainable business growth.


💡 Key Insights

▪️ Net Sales grew by ~350% in FY 2022, yet Net profit % remained negative due to rising operational and marketing expenses.

▪️ APAC led overall Net Sales, while North America showed high sales but only ~5% PC market penetration.

▪️India emerged as the fastest-growing PC market with ~13% of market share.

▪️The Notebook segment delivered strong revenue growth but suffered from negative profitability driven by high marketing spend.

▪️Flat discounting strategies are eroding Gross Margins, highlighting the need for smarter discount models.

▪️Supply chain disruptions caused stock shortages (FY 2021–2022) and excess inventory in earlier years.

▪️AtliQ’s PC market share grew from ~1% to ~6%, though Dale continues to dominate.
