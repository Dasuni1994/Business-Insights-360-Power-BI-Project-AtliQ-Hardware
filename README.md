## Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project | AtliQ Hardware

Excited to share my latest Power BI bootcamp project, where I built an end-to-end Business Insights 360 dashboard for AtliQ Hardware  - analyzing financial, sales, marketing, and supply chain data to uncover actionable insights and support strategic decision-making.

<h3>Project Objectiv</h3>

 Design an intuitive, stakeholder-friendly Power BI dashboard to improve data accessibility, enable faster decisions, and drive sustainable business growth.


<h3>Key Insights</h3>

▪️ Net Sales grew by ~350% in FY 2022, yet Net profit % remained negative due to rising operational and marketing expenses.

▪️ APAC led overall Net Sales, while North America showed high sales but only ~5% PC market penetration.

▪️India emerged as the fastest-growing PC market with ~13% of market share.

▪️The Notebook segment delivered strong revenue growth but suffered from negative profitability driven by high marketing spend.

▪️Flat discounting strategies are eroding Gross Margins, highlighting the need for smarter discount models.

▪️Supply chain disruptions caused stock shortages (FY 2021–2022) and excess inventory in earlier years.

▪️AtliQ’s PC market share grew from ~1% to ~6%, though Dale continues to dominate.

▪️Sales peak between September and December, emphasizing the need for better inventory alignment.

▪️High marketing costs in the UK and Germany indicate opportunities to improve ROI.



<h3>Strategic Recommendations</h3>

▪️Reduce operational and marketing expenses after market capture to improve Net Profit %.

▪️Implement performance-based discounting by product and customer.

▪️Expand distribution and targeted marketing in APAC—especially India.

▪️Reassess Notebook pricing and cost structures to restore profitability.

▪️Reposition or redesign underperforming USB flash drive products.

▪️Leverage real-time data for demand forecasting to avoid stock imbalances.

▪️Strengthen PC market strategies in North America and differentiate to compete with Dale.

▪️Optimize marketing spend in the UK and Germany.

▪️Align inventory planning and promotions with peak demand (Sep–Dec).



<h3>Learning Outcome</h3>

 This project significantly strengthened my data cleaning, DAX, and dashboard design skills, while deepening my understanding of real-world business KPIs and decision-making.
